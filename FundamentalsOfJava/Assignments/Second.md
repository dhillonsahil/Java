# Question 1. What is statically typed and Dynamically typed Programming Language ?
**Statically typed**  
>If we have to define the type of Data Being given like int age; String name so that are basically Statically Typed data and memory is allocated to them at the compile time.

**Dynamically typed** 
>if there is no need to define the type of data while writing code that is called dynamically typed data. The memory is allocated to this type of programming is at the run time.Example  :- in python we directly use variable with value (age = 20)

___
# Question 2. What is the variable in the Java?
A variable in any programming language is the name given to a memory location where the value is stored. If we want to access the value , we don’t have to remember its memory location we can just simply use the Variable name

___
# Question 3.  How to assign a value to a variable ?
To assign a value to a variable we first declare a variable and then the value is assigned at the right hand side. It can be done in two ways :- 
* int age;
* age = 20;
     
     or

* int age = 20;
___
# Question 4. What are primitive data types in java ?
The data types which are predefined while creating the language and their names are a reserved keywords.
The 8 primitive data types are :- byte , short , int , long, float , double , char , boolean 

___
# Question 5. What are identifiers in Java ?
Identifiers in java are the names assigned to any Variable , method , class , interface , array etc.
* Case sensitive
* Start from Alphabets between [A to Z] or [a to z]
* Can’t contain space
* Can only contain two special character $ or _
* Can’t start from a number but can contain a number
* Can’t be same as a reserved keyword

___
# Question 6.List the operators in Java?
 Operators are used to provide operations on the operands.
1. Arithmetic Operator :- (+,-,*,/,%)
1. Relational Operator :- (<,>,<=,>=,==,!=)
1. Logical Operator :- (&& , || , !)
1. Bitwise Operator :- (& ,| , ^)
1. Unary Operator :- (+,-)
1. Assignment Operator :- (=)

___
# Question 7. Explain about Increment and Decrement Operators and give an example ?
The Increment and decrement operators are used to increase or decrease the value of a variable by 1. 
These are of two types Pre and Post.
> Pre :- the value is increased and decreased before using

Example:-    

 int a = 25;

 Int b= ++a


Here value of b = 26
 > Post :- the value is inceased or decreased after using

 Example
 
 int a =25
 
 int b==a++

 here value of b = 25
